# PyTorch Basics - Tensor Operations

Welcome to the first exercise of the PyTorch Cookbook! This exercise will guide you through the basics of tensor operations in PyTorch. By completing this exercise, you will gain a foundational understanding of how to create and manipulate tensors in PyTorch.

## Objectives

- Create tensors of different dimensions.
- Perform element-wise tensor operations.
- Understand tensor attributes such as shape and datatype.
- Practice tensor indexing and slicing.

## Exercise Tasks

1. **Tensor Creation**: You will create three types of tensors:

   - A 1D tensor of size 10 filled with zeros.
   - A 2D tensor of size 3x3 filled with random numbers from a uniform distribution.
   - A tensor created from a Python list of numbers.

2. **Tensor Operations**: You will perform the following operations:

   - Element-wise addition and multiplication of tensors.
   - Calculate the mean and standard deviation of a tensor.
   - Resize/reshape a 2D tensor to a different shape.

3. **Tensor Indexing**: Practice indexing by selecting the second element from a 1D tensor.
